## Install

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:Aadv1k/frontend-projects.git
$ npm install # Install deps
$ npm run build --ws # Run the build command in the packages
```

Now you can simply load up `./index.html` in a browser.

## Scripts

- `npm run cleanAll`: Purges all files in `@frontend-projects/PACKAGE/design/` except the design preview; Also removes other unwanted files
- `npm run build`: WIP - Copies all the packages to a `./www/` directory and renames them appropriately
- `npm run femFetch`: A utility script to fetch challenge files from [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io)

## Structure

- `./config`: Configuration scripts for dev tools - ESLint, Webpack, Prettier
- `./scripts/`: Utility shell scripts to organize, clean and fetch files in the project
- `./frontendmentor.io/`: Primary package directory it contains projects from [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io)

## Architecture

This Monorepo is managed using a (minimal) npm workspace config since
currently, I don't feel the need to use something like lerna, but it is a
possibility for the future depending on the complexity of this repo. The
primary package folder is `./frontendmentor.io/`.

_Note: currently there are no inner-deps_
