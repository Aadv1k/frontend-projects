### Inbrowser markdown editor

this challenge was tough, but hey, thats how you learn. Looking back, I should've probably 

- Structured my app better (Currently, the codebase is a MESS)
- Used the Context API instead of states, prop drilling and whatnot
- Not used css modules, or atleast should've tried it out, since in a project
  of this size, it was HELL managing the modules and css not being "cascading",
  although I am aware, with the right setup It would've been better, but whats
  done is done 
- A custom hook to use localStorage, instead of manually getting/setting it everywhere

I would love to re-vist this challenge in the future, right now, I will take a break from this specific codebase.
