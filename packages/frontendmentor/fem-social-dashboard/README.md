### Finally shifting to webpack

From Gulp to `sass --watch` I figured it is finally time for me to upgrade my
setup to webpack, although it's not the "hottest" out there, but Its better to
learn about A bundler than to learn about the "best bundler" as a beginner.

### Components and SASS organization

First project where I made extensive use of components. I have a file called `_components.scss` where three "reusable" classes are put, `.card` being the most used. It was hard to not over complicated things by unknowingly building a mini tailwind but eventually I just put a bunch of styles inside the `.card`.
